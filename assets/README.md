# Assets

The assets used in this code are public and free to use. To support the creators of those assets, instead of adding them directly, I will provide the links and instructions on how to use them in this project.

### Assets package

Copy the 'Animations', 'Audio', and 'Sprites' folders into the project's 'assets/FlappyBat' directory.

### Font

Copy the Silver.ttf into the 'assets' folder.
